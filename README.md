# lively4-chrome-debugger

## Abstract
The Lively4 Chrome Debugger aims to provide a scriptable debugger for Lively4.
It consists of two parts: a Chrome extension and a `<lively-debugger>`
component for Lively4.
The extension exposes a `lively4ChromeDebugger` object in the Lively4 page
context in order to provide access to the `chrome.*` APIs, which are required by
the debugger UI.
Also, it allows to evaluate code in all currently available contexts (content
script, background page, Chrome DevTools, and Lively4 panel in Chrome DevTools).

The main task of the object is to expose the `chrome.debugger` API and offer
convenience methods for functions like getting all debug targets or attaching
the debugger to a page.
Furthermore, the object is able to send generic commands to the `chrome` API in
order to access the whole range of functions available through the interface.
Every call returns a *Promise*, which contains the execution result after the
asynchronous request has completed.

The debugger can be accessed from the Lively4 context menu.
After selecting a debuggee, standard debugging buttons like step into and step
over are available.
Any command can be executed automatically, a chosen number of times at a given
step speed.
Additionally, it is possible to control the debugger with an interactive
Debugger workspace.
Users can also edit code live at runtime, without having to reload the page.
Lastly, the debugger also provides access to Chrome's profiler. 


## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Activate the developer mode in Google Chrome.
3. Click on *"Load unpacked extensionâ€¦"* and choose the cloned directory
   (the extension should be loaded and activated).
4. Open a Lively4 page and
  - the extension will expose a global `lively4ChromeDebugger` object;
  - the `<lively-debugger>` component can be opened via the context menu;
  - the Chrome extension extends the Chrome DevTools with a Lively4 panel.
