# lively4-chrome-debugger

## Abstract
The Lively4 Chrome Debugger aims to provide an IDE like debugger for Lively4. It consists of two major parts: a Chrome extension and the debugger UI. The extension exposes a *lively4ChromeDebugger* object to the Lively4 page in order to have access to the chrome.\* API, which is required by the debugger. <br>
The main task of the object is to expose the chrome.debugger API and offer convenience methods for functions like getting all debuggable scripts or attaching the debugger to a page. Furthermore the object is able to send generic commands to the chrome API in order to access the whole range of functions available through the interface. Every call returns a Promise, that contains the execution result after the asynchronous request is finished.<br>
The debugger can be accessed from the Lively4 context menu. After selecting a debuggee standard debugging buttons like step into and over are displayed. Any command can be executed automatically a chosen number of times with a given step speed. Additionally users can edit code live without reloading the page. Changes will be taken into account by the following statements. Besides the debugger offers a basic profiler.
